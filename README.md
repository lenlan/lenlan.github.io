# About Me

<br>
I am a computational biologist/health data scientist with over 6 years of experience. My interests include: leveraging machine learning to analyze health data including multi-omics and real-world data for improving patient prognosis and enabling precision medicine.<br><br>
During my PhD in the [Bioengineering Department at UCSD](https://be.ucsd.edu/) I focused on using AI/ML for infectious disease diagnostics in the context of systems medicine as part of the [Fraley Lab](https://fraley.ucsd.edu/systems-medicine).<br> 
<br> 
My PhD resulted in publications in Bioinformatics and Biomicrofluidics:<br> 

> [*Data-driven noise modeling of digital DNA melting analysis enables prediction of sequence discriminating power*](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1053) Lennart Langouche, April Aralar, Mridu Sinha, Shelley M Lawrence, Stephanie I Fraley, Todd P Coleman; Bioinformatics (2020)<br>
<br>

> [*A microfluidic design for desalination and selective removal and addition of components in biosamples*](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5093348) Wei Cai, Edward Wang, Ping-Wei Chen, Yi-Huan Tsai, Lennart Langouche, Yu-Hwa Lo; Biomicrofluidics (2019)<br>
<br>

> [*Advancing Rapid Infectious Disease Screening Using a Combined Experimental/Computational Approach*](https://escholarship.org/content/qt16x0t2x3/qt16x0t2x3_noSplash_01cb415bf9021eaf7221ce26ae44cb60.pdf) Lennart Langouche; Dissertation (2021)<br>
