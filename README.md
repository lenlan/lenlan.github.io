# About Me

<br>
I am a computational biologist/machine learning scientist with over 6 years of experience. My interests include: leveraging machine learning to analyze health data including multi-omics and real-world data for improving patient prognosis and enabling precision medicine.<br><br>
During my PhD in the [Bioengineering Department at UCSD](https://be.ucsd.edu/) I focused on using AI/ML for infectious disease diagnostics in the context of systems medicine as part of the [Fraley Lab](https://fraley.ucsd.edu/systems-medicine). My PhD resulted in publications in Bioinformatics and Biomicrofluidics:<br> 

> **L. Langouche**, [*Advancing Rapid Infectious Disease Screening Using a Combined Experimental/Computational Approach*](https://escholarship.org/content/qt16x0t2x3/qt16x0t2x3_noSplash_01cb415bf9021eaf7221ce26ae44cb60.pdf), University of California, San Diego (2021)<br>

> **L. Langouche**, A. Aralar, M. Sinha, S.M. Lawrence, S.I. Fraley, T.P. Coleman, [*Data-driven noise modeling of digital DNA melting analysis enables prediction of sequence discriminating power*](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1053), Bioinformatics, 6 (2020)<br>

> W. Cai, E. Wang, P.W. Chen, Y.H. Tsai, **L. Langouche**, Y.H. Lo, [*A microfluidic design for desalination and selective removal and addition of components in biosamples*](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5093348), Biomicrofluidics, 13.2 (2019)<br>
<br>

During my PhD I interned at [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/), where I gained a better understanding of genomics and product management. After my PhD I worked as a Life Sciences Strategy Consultant for two years at [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/), where I became experienced at leading small teams to address complex business challenges for major pharmaceutical companies.<br>
<br>
Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities that empower me to spearhead initiatives generating impactful societal change at the forefront of innovation. I'm primarily interested in biotech, climate tech, and health tech but open to other opportunities. <br>
<br>
I recently published a two-part blog post, combining my passion for healthcare and machine learning, where I [embed multi-modal clinical trial data](https://medium.com/@lennart.langouche/clinical-trial-outcome-prediction-a4c6d279fd42?source=friends_link&sk=9e2330d6cf1fe4548f5d94965bfec825) with large language models and use those embeddings to train a machine learning model to [predict clinical trial outcomes](https://medium.com/@lennart.langouche/clinical-trial-outcome-prediction-7ce6c27831f9?source=friends_link&sk=f65fd3cce048a5e72ffe54673062e70f).<br>
