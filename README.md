# About Me

<br>
I am a computational biologist/health data scientist with over 6 years of experience.<br>
My interests include: leveraging machine learning to analyze health data including multi-omics and real-world data for improving patient prognosis and enabling precision medicine.<br><br>

During my PhD in the [Bioengineering Department at UCSD](https://be.ucsd.edu/) I focused on using AI/ML for infectious disease diagnostics.<br> 
My thesis project resulted in a **first-author** publications in Bioinformatics:<br>

> [*Data-driven noise modeling of digital DNA melting analysis enables prediction of sequence discriminating power*](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1053) Lennart Langouche, April Aralar, Mridu Sinha, Shelley M Lawrence, Stephanie I Fraley, Todd P Coleman<br>
