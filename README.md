# About Me

<br>
I am a computational biologist/machine learning scientist with over 6 years of experience. My interests include: leveraging machine learning to analyze health data including multi-omics and real-world data for improving patient prognosis and enabling precision medicine.<br><br>
During my PhD in the [Bioengineering Department at UCSD](https://be.ucsd.edu/) I focused on using AI/ML for infectious disease diagnostics in the context of systems medicine as part of the [Fraley Lab](https://fraley.ucsd.edu/systems-medicine).<br> 
<br> 
My PhD resulted in publications in Bioinformatics and Biomicrofluidics:<br> 

> L. Langouche, [*Advancing Rapid Infectious Disease Screening Using a Combined Experimental/Computational Approach*](https://escholarship.org/content/qt16x0t2x3/qt16x0t2x3_noSplash_01cb415bf9021eaf7221ce26ae44cb60.pdf), University of California, San Diego (2021)<br>
<br>
> L. Langouche, A. Aralar, M. Sinha, S.M. Lawrence, S.I. Fraley, T.P. Coleman, [*Data-driven noise modeling of digital DNA melting analysis enables prediction of sequence discriminating power*](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1053), Bioinformatics, 6 (2020)<br>
<br>

<br>
After my PhD I worked in Life Sciences Management Consulting for two years at [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/). I got experience in leading small teams to solve complex business cases for large pharmaceutical companies. <br>
Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities that not only push the boundaries of technology but also empower me to spearhead initiatives generating impactful societal change at the forefront of innovation. I'm primarily interested in biotech, climate tech, and health tech but open to other opportunities. <br>
I recently published a two-part [blog-post](https://medium.com/@lennart.langouche/clinical-trial-outcome-prediction-a4c6d279fd42?source=friends_link&sk=9e2330d6cf1fe4548f5d94965bfec825) on embedding multi-modal health data using large language models and using those embeddings to [predict clinical trial outcomes](https://medium.com/@lennart.langouche/clinical-trial-outcome-prediction-7ce6c27831f9?source=friends_link&sk=f65fd3cce048a5e72ffe54673062e70f).
